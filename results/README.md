# Advanced Topics in Database Systems --Results--

This folder contains the results computed by the queries. Each successive folder contains the answer to the query in csv format, as well as the plots for the first three queries. The folder named hint_and_explain
contains three folders, one for each mode of explain(). 

> [!NOTE]
> The output file of the query results uses "|" as separator, while timers use "," as separator. If you want to change the separator for the results file,
> you can use change_separator.py inside the helper-code folder, which takes as a parameter the path to the file you want to edit and changes the file.
