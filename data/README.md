In this project, the main data set used is the crimes in LA from [2010-2019](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-2019) and from [2020-Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). Alternatively, the following links can be used:
* [2010-2019](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z)
* [2020-Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)

In those links, the files are offered in various formats. However, for this project, the .csv versions were used.

> [!NOTE]
> The two files were too big to upload to this repository, this is why the links are provided. The remaining files used in the
> project can be found in this repository

In the project, the queries described in the assignment assume that there is one dataset from 2010-Present. This is why there is a file in the helper-code folder, that combines the two datasets into one big dataset named "Crime_Data_from_2010_to_Present".
